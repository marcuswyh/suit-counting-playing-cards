Count the number of cards and its corresponding suits within an image regardless of orientation using OpenCV.

<b><i>Abstract — In this  paper  we  present  an  algorithm for  playing card  detection  and  suit  identification.  This  algorithm  is robust enough  to  detect  and  count  cards  and  its  respective  suits  with moderate  card  rotation  and  photograph  angle,  and  is  achieved through   thresholding,   perspective   correction,   and   template matching. The  system  is  tested  using  a  variety  of  computer generated images as well as camera captured images and returned a satisfying accuracy rate of more than 90%.

Keywords — template matching, perspective correction, thresholding, suit detection, card counting</b></i>
